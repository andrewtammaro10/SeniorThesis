Author: Andrew Tammaro

Date: December 2020

Advisor: Jun Yan

Topic: Can college statistics and combine measurements be used to predict quarterback success at the professional level? All coding was done in R; techniques include data manipulation, linear regression, and variable selection.

I am looking forward to updating and redoing this analysis with my new skills and tools learned at the Institute for Advanced Analytics.
